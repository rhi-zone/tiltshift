# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the tiltshift repository.

## Project Overview

Iterative structure extraction from opaque binary data

Part of the [rhi ecosystem](https://rhi.zone).

## Architecture

Single crate at `tiltshift/` (lib + bin). Key modules: `signals/` (one extractor per file, wired in `signals/mod.rs::extract_all`), `types.rs` (Region, Signal, SignalKind, Hypothesis, PartialSchema), `hypothesis.rs`, `corpus/`, `opcodes.rs`, `loader.rs` (mmap), `probe.rs`, `session.rs`, `cluster.rs`.

**Adding a signal extractor:**
1. Create `signals/<name>.rs` exporting `scan_<name>(data: &[u8]) -> Vec<Signal>`
2. Add variant(s) to `SignalKind` in `types.rs`
3. `pub mod <name>` + call in `extract_all` in `signals/mod.rs`
4. Add display section + summary count in `main.rs` `cmd_analyze`

All 16 extractors run in parallel via rayon `into_par_iter()` over boxed closures. Extractors returning `Option<Signal>` (chisq, compress) need `.into_iter().collect()` to coerce.

**Grammar TOML files** under `~/.config/tiltshift/opcodes/<name>.toml` are human-authored verification outputs — never read by signal extractors.

**Bytecode signal** is format-agnostic (no opcode tables). `top5_dominance ≥ 0.20` is the hard gate preventing random/periodic data from emitting — real instruction sets always exceed this; random data spreads to ≤16%.

**Hypothesis engine** has four passes: compound string tables → cross-signal compounds (magic+chunk, TLV+varint, repeated+alignment) → file-wide characterization (chisq+compress+ngram) → direct single-signal. `EntropyBlock` and `Padding` skipped (too fine-grained).

**Session cache** sidecar `<file>.tiltshift.toml` reused if `file_size` matches. Annotated spans skip recursive descent. `cluster` uses a separate lightweight `<file>.tiltshift.features.toml` cache — never loads the full signal session cache (OOM risk on large files).

**Signal output caps** exist to prevent session cache OOM (a 24MB image once produced 131MB cache):
- `strings.rs`: adaptive `MIN_LEN` scales 4→32 with `4 + ilog2(file_len / 65536) * 4`
- `varint.rs`: `MAX_VARINT_SIGNALS = 500`
- `entropy.rs`: `MAX_ENTROPY_BLOCKS = 2000` with uniform sampling; stride must equal `block_size` (non-overlapping) — earlier `stride=block/4` gave 4× signals

## Development

```bash
nix develop        # Enter dev shell
cargo test         # Run tests
cargo clippy       # Lint
cd docs && bun dev # Local docs
```

If a tool appears missing, you are outside `nix develop`. Do not assume the tool is unavailable to the project.

## Context Is The Only Scarce Resource

Every byte that enters the main session stays in the main session for its entire lifetime. File contents, command output, search results, page text — once read, it lingers in cache and shapes every downstream token. There is no "just looking."

**All exploration runs in subagents.** Investigations, audits, deep dives, surveys, "let me check," "let me find" — if the purpose of a tool sequence is to find out something you don't yet know, it runs in a subagent. Renaming the activity does not change what it is. The subagent returns a distilled summary; the raw output stays in the subagent.

The main session holds only the durable artifacts you are producing: the edit, the commit, the doc update.

**Subagent model tiers:**
- Opus — design, architecture, any subagent that itself spawns subagents.
- Sonnet — implementation, mechanical multi-file work, default exploration.

Use Opus for exploration only when the search requires architectural judgment, not lookup.

## Durability

Subagent reports, mid-session realizations, "I'll remember this" — none of these outlast the session. Anything worth keeping goes into CLAUDE.md, code, docs, or a commit. If it isn't written down, it is gone.

**Commit completed work immediately.** After tests pass, commit. After each phase of a multi-phase plan, commit. Uncommitted work is lost work, and accumulated uncommitted phases lose isolation as well.

**Docs change in the same commit as the code.** New pages enter the sidebar in that commit. There is no follow-up.

Problems, tech debt, issues → TODO.md now, in the same response. Future/deferred scope → TODO.md **before** writing any code. If you write a TODO comment in source, the next action is to open TODO.md and write the entry. Code comments and conversation mentions are not tracked items.

## Authenticity

When asked to analyze X, read X. Do not synthesize from conversation memory, prior summaries, or what the file probably says. Claims must correspond to evidence produced this session.

**Something unexpected is a signal.** Surprising output, anomalous numbers, a file containing what it shouldn't — stop and find out why. Do not accept the anomaly and proceed.

## Discipline

Corrections from the user are conversation, not material for new rules. A single correction does not warrant a CLAUDE.md edit. Rules are added when a failure mode is observed repeatedly and the rule names the failure it prevents.

Do not announce actions ("I will now…"). Act.

## Workflow

**Batch cargo commands** to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test -q
```
After editing multiple files, run the full check once — not after each edit. `cargo fmt` runs in the pre-commit hook.

**Prefer `cargo test -q`** over `cargo test` — quiet mode only prints failures, significantly reducing output noise and context usage.

**Bigram tables must be heap-allocated** (`vec![0u32; 65536]`) — stack allocation (256 KB) overflows in debug builds.

**Clippy enforces:** `.is_multiple_of()` not `% 2 != 0`; `.is_power_of_two()` not `v & (v-1) == 0`; `.is_none_or(…)` / `.is_some_and(…)` not `Option::map_or(true/false, …)`.

**When making the same change across multiple crates**, edit all files first, then build once.

**Minimize file churn.** When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass. Avoid read-edit-build-fail-read-fix cycles by thinking through the complete change before starting.

`normalize view` gives structural outlines without pulling full file bodies into context:
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>
```

## Commit Convention

Conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`. Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Hard Constraints

- No `--no-verify`. Fix the issue or fix the hook.
- No path dependencies in `Cargo.toml` — they couple repos and break independent publishing.
- No interactive git (`git add -p`, `git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) — these block on stdin and hang.
- No assuming a tool is missing without checking `nix develop`.
