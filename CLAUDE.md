# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral rules for Claude Code in the tiltshift repository.

## Project Overview

Iterative structure extraction from opaque binary data

Part of the [rhi ecosystem](https://rhi.zone).

## Architecture

Single crate at `tiltshift/` (lib + bin). Key modules: `signals/` (one extractor per file, wired in `signals/mod.rs::extract_all`), `types.rs` (Region, Signal, SignalKind, Hypothesis, PartialSchema), `hypothesis.rs`, `corpus/`, `opcodes.rs`, `loader.rs` (mmap), `probe.rs`, `session.rs`, `cluster.rs`.

**Adding a signal extractor:**
1. Create `signals/<name>.rs` exporting `scan_<name>(data: &[u8]) -> Vec<Signal>`
2. Add variant(s) to `SignalKind` in `types.rs`
3. `pub mod <name>` + call in `extract_all` in `signals/mod.rs`
4. Add display section + summary count in `main.rs` `cmd_analyze`

All 16 extractors run in parallel via rayon `into_par_iter()` over boxed closures. Extractors returning `Option<Signal>` (chisq, compress) need `.into_iter().collect()` to coerce.

**Grammar TOML files** under `~/.config/tiltshift/opcodes/<name>.toml` are human-authored verification outputs — never read by signal extractors.

**Bytecode signal** is format-agnostic (no opcode tables). `top5_dominance ≥ 0.20` is the hard gate preventing random/periodic data from emitting — real instruction sets always exceed this; random data spreads to ≤16%.

**Hypothesis engine** has four passes: compound string tables → cross-signal compounds (magic+chunk, TLV+varint, repeated+alignment) → file-wide characterization (chisq+compress+ngram) → direct single-signal. `EntropyBlock` and `Padding` skipped (too fine-grained).

**Session cache** sidecar `<file>.tiltshift.toml` reused if `file_size` matches. Annotated spans skip recursive descent. `cluster` uses a separate lightweight `<file>.tiltshift.features.toml` cache — never loads the full signal session cache (OOM risk on large files).

**Signal output caps** exist to prevent session cache OOM (a 24MB image once produced 131MB cache):
- `strings.rs`: adaptive `MIN_LEN` scales 4→32 with `4 + ilog2(file_len / 65536) * 4`
- `varint.rs`: `MAX_VARINT_SIGNALS = 500`
- `entropy.rs`: `MAX_ENTROPY_BLOCKS = 2000` with uniform sampling; stride must equal `block_size` (non-overlapping) — earlier `stride=block/4` gave 4× signals

## Development

```bash
nix develop        # Enter dev shell
cargo test         # Run tests
cargo clippy       # Lint
cd docs && bun dev # Local docs
```

## Core Rules

**Note things down immediately — no deferral:**
- Problems, tech debt, issues → TODO.md now, in the same response
- Design decisions, key insights → docs/ or CLAUDE.md
- Future/deferred scope → TODO.md **before** writing any code, not after
- **Every observed problem → TODO.md. No exceptions.** Code comments and conversation mentions are not tracked items. If you write a TODO comment in source, the next action is to open TODO.md and write the entry.

**Conversation is not memory.** Anything said in chat evaporates at session end. If it implies future behavior change, write it to CLAUDE.md immediately — or it will not happen.

**Warning — these phrases mean something needs to be written down right now:**
- "I won't do X again" / "I'll remember to..." / "I've learned that..."
- "Next time I'll..." / "From now on I'll..."
- Any acknowledgement of a recurring error without a corresponding CLAUDE.md edit

**Triggers:** User corrects you, 2+ failed attempts, "aha" moment, framework quirk discovered → document before proceeding.

**When the user corrects you:** Ask what rule would have prevented this, and write it before proceeding. **"The rule exists, I just didn't follow it" is never the diagnosis** — a rule that doesn't prevent the failure it describes is incomplete; fix the rule, not your behavior.

**Corrections are documentation lag, not model failure.** When the same mistake recurs, the fix is writing the invariant down — not repeating the correction. Every correction that doesn't produce a CLAUDE.md edit will happen again. Exception: during active design, corrections are the work itself — don't prematurely document a design that hasn't settled yet.

**Something unexpected is a signal, not noise.** Surprising output, anomalous numbers, files containing what they shouldn't — stop and ask why before continuing. Don't accept anomalies and move on.

**Do the work properly.** Don't leave workarounds or hacks undocumented. When asked to analyze X, actually read X — don't synthesize from conversation.

## Design Principles

**Unify, don't multiply.** One interface for multiple cases > separate interfaces. Plugin systems > hardcoded switches.

**Simplicity over cleverness.** HashMap > inventory crate. OnceLock > lazy_static. Functions > traits until you need the trait. Use ecosystem tooling over hand-rolling.

**Explicit over implicit.** Log when skipping. Show what's at stake before refusing.

**Separate niche from shared.** Don't bloat shared config with feature-specific data. Use separate files for specialized data.

## Workflow

**Batch cargo commands** to minimize round-trips:
```bash
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings && cargo test -q
```
After editing multiple files, run the full check once — not after each edit. Formatting is handled automatically by the pre-commit hook (`cargo fmt`).

**Bigram tables must be heap-allocated** (`vec![0u32; 65536]`) — stack allocation (256 KB) overflows in debug builds.

**Clippy enforces:** `.is_multiple_of()` not `% 2 != 0`; `.is_power_of_two()` not `v & (v-1) == 0`; `.is_none_or(…)` / `.is_some_and(…)` not `Option::map_or(true/false, …)`.

**Prefer `cargo test -q`** over `cargo test` — quiet mode only prints failures, significantly reducing output noise and context usage.

**When making the same change across multiple crates**, edit all files first, then build once.

**Minimize file churn.** When editing a file, read it once, plan all changes, and apply them in one pass. Avoid read-edit-build-fail-read-fix cycles by thinking through the complete change before starting.

**Always commit completed work.** After tests pass, commit immediately — don't wait to be asked. When a plan has multiple phases, commit after each phase passes. Do not accumulate changes across phases. Uncommitted work is lost work.

**`normalize view` is available** for structural outlines of files and directories:
```bash
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <file>    # outline with line numbers
~/git/rhizone/normalize/target/debug/normalize view <dir>     # directory structure
```

## Context Management

**All exploration goes in subagents.** Any tool call whose purpose is "find out what's here" — grep, find, broad reads, surveys, audits — runs in a subagent. Raw exploratory output in the main context is active context poisoning: it lingers in cache, shapes downstream reasoning, can't be unsent. The subagent returns a distilled summary; the noise stays in the subagent.

Inline tool use in the main context is reserved for:
- Reading a known file at a known path
- Edits/writes you're committing to
- A single targeted lookup whose result you'll act on immediately

If you find yourself running a second grep to refine the first, you should have spawned a subagent.

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): message`

Types:
- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `chore` - Maintenance (deps, CI, etc.)
- `test` - Adding or updating tests

Scope is optional but recommended for multi-crate repos.

## Negative Constraints

Do not:
- Announce actions ("I will now...") - just do them
- Leave work uncommitted
- Use interactive git commands (`git add -p`, `git add -i`, `git rebase -i`) — these block on stdin and hang in non-interactive shells; stage files by name instead
- Use path dependencies in Cargo.toml - causes clippy to stash changes across repos
- Use `--no-verify` - fix the issue or fix the hook
- Assume tools are missing - check if `nix develop` is available for the right environment
